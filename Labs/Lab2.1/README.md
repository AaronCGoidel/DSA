## Analysis of Algorithms: Time Comparisons
Consider the problem of determining whether or not a number is prime. There are a number of different methods of solving this problem, some are more obvious than others. Write three different solutions. Provide a runtime analysis for each and you'll show test data for each to support your analysis.

Write the solutions first, making sure they work as anticipated and then analyze their runtime. Record the analysis and any calculations in a document to be submited.

You'll be given a .txt file with arrays of integers of increasing length. There are 100 integers in each array with integers of length 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 digits. They are randomly generated integers. This file is included in the repo. You will run your algorithms and time them, recording the time taken in a file. You should record the average time taken bby each algorithm for a given length number. Plot this information on a graph, comparing the runtime, given the length of the integer, for each different solution. Helper functions for measuring time and reading from a file are included in the AlgoAnalysisHelper.cpp in the repo. 

What you will be turning in:
- A C++ file that includes all 3 of the primality testing implementations.
- The averate times for each algorithm by size of input and a graph comparing the average runtimes.
- Your runtime analysis for each - which could be in a comment in each function.
- A reflection comparing your calculated runtime and your analysis for each algorithm.
