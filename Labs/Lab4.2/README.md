# Huffman-Encoding
Your assignment is to create a Huffman Encoder. Given a txt file as input, compress the text using Huffman's algorithm. Your output should be another txt file containing only 0s and 1s. You will not be required to write a decoder. 

## Parts of the Algorithm
- Frequency count (I would suggest doing this while reading in the text)
- Adding to heap
- Combining nodes to make the Huffman tree
- Compressing each character with the tree. Left is a 0 and right is a 1
